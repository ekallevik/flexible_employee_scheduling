            Mostly the same structure as Even had put up. Start by selecting a destroy and repair operator.

            Candidate solution is created by copying the current solution state.
            Problem not fixed is how to send the correct sets together with the destroy and repair operator. 
            All my destroy operators have two values they are returning:
                1. A destroy set that includes shifts (e,t,v) that are destroyed
                2. Some spesific information about what were destroyed for example weeks, isolated days and so on. 

            Calculate objective function is new. It is in charge of updating the soft variables, hard variables, f and objective function
            based on the destroy and repair operator (the shifts that were destroyed and repaired)

            Lastly consider candidate is run.
